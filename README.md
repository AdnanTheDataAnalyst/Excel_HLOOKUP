# HLOOKUP

The HLOOKUP function in Excel is a horizontal lookup tool that searches for a specific value in the first row of a given range and returns a corresponding value from a specified row. In the provided data example, if you want to find out which state Harley Fritz is from, you can use the formula `=HLOOKUP("Harley Fritz", A2:E4, 4, FALSE)`. This formula looks for "Harley Fritz" in the first row (Customer IDs) and retrieves the corresponding value from the fourth row (States), resulting in "New York."
